Fight Generator
===

A Ruby script to generate random sequences for fight choreography.

====
Prerequisites
====

You will need Ruby installed on your machine. I recommend using RVM to manage your Ruby versions.

====
Running the Script
====

In terminal:

  ruby fight_generator.rb

When prompted, provide a number of phrases and a max number of moves per phrase.

The script will provide a randomized series of attacks and responses for each fighter.

====
Roadmap
====

Build/incorporate into a Rails or Sinatra app. App will generate a randomized fight for each actor. Should have views designed for iphone, ipad, etc.
